<p>As a part of <a href="https://sites.google.com/schools.nyc.gov/cs4allnyc/home">CS4All NYC</a>, I teach 6th graders Computer Science/Coding using p5.js with the <a href="https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/curriculum/creative-web/">Creative Web curriculum</a>. There is also a similar high school curriculum about p5.js, <a href="https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/introduction-to-computational-media-curriculum/">Introduction to Computational Media (ICM)</a>. I have co-facilitated CS4All NYC professional development about both Creative Web and ICM.</p>


<h2>Student Work</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of my students' work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Robot or Car Project:</li>
  <ul><li>Students design and code their own robot or car image in p5.js: <a href=""></a></li></ul>
    <li>Emoji Project: </li>
      <ul>
      <li>Students design and code an emoji that represents something that is impotant to them or represents a change they want to see in the world.  Students also make a small webpage with HTML and CSS to present their emoji.</li>

<h2>Materials and Supports for Teachers and Students</h2>

<h3>Desmos Activties for Students</h3>
    
<p>To support my students with expressing themselves with p5, I have written some Desmos activities to help them understand the p5 coordinate grid and visualize the basic shapes and place them in their p5 sketches. 
 <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">Desmos Activity Builder</a> does require you to sign up to use activties, but it is free.  I've also presented at TeachersCon 2022 about these Desmos activties:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KD9BCJMy6nSGkW_hq3c6rvJpF_8wQ93PpaKDb2r5KlE/edit?usp=sharing">presentation slides</a> </p>
